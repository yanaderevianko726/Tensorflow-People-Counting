Here are some cool capabilities of TensorFlow Object Counting API:

- Detect just the targeted objects
- Detect all the objects
- Count just the targeted objects
- Count all the objects
- Predict color of the targeted objects
- Predict color of all the objects
- Predict speed of the targeted objects
- Predict speed of all the objects
- Print out the detection-counting result in a .csv file as an analysis report
- Save and store detected objects as new images under [detected_object folder](www)
- Select, download and use state of the art [models that are trained by Google Brain Team](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
- Use [your own trained models](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) or [a fine-tuned model](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/10_Fine-Tuning.ipynb) to detect spesific object/s
- Save detection and counting results as a new video or show detection and counting results in real time
- Process images or videos depending on your requirements

Here are some cool architectural design features of TensorFlow Object Counting API:

- Lightweigth, runs in real-time
- Scalable and well-designed framework, easy usage
- Gets "Pythonic Approach" advantages
- It supports REST Architecture and RESTful Web Services

TODOs:

- TensorFlox2.x support will be provided.
- Autonomus Training Image Annotation Tool will be developed.
- GUI will be developed.

- Object detection and classification have been developed on top of TensorFlow Object Detection API.

- Object color prediction has been developed using OpenCV via K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning Classification Algorithm is Trained Color Histogram Features.

[TensorFlowâ„¢](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.

[OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)](https://opencv.org/about.html) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

### Tracker

Source video is read frame by frame with OpenCV. Each frames is processed by ["SSD with Mobilenet" model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17) is developed on TensorFlow. This is a loop that continue working till reaching end of the video. The main pipeline of the tracker is given at the above Figure.

For detailed steps to install Tensorflow, follow the [Tensorflow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). 

### Important: Compatibility problems caused by TensorFlow2 version.

This project developed with TensorFlow 1.5.0 version. If you need to run this project with TensorFlow 2.x version, just replace tensorflow imports with tensorflow.compat.v1, and add tf.disable_v2_behavior that's all. 

Instead of this import statement:

    import tensorflow

use this:

    import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
    tf.disable_v2_behavior()
